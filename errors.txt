1.  Tiptap is a browser-only editor, It touches window It measures DOM It uses document... 
    when Next.js tries to render it on the server, Tiptap detects SSR and throws error.

2.  Pagination currently operates at block-node level (paragraphs, headings, lists).
    Very large single paragraphs that exceed a page height are not split mid-paragraph and will occupy their own page.
    This mirrors a simplified pagination model suitable for a prototype and can be improved by line-level pagination in future iterations.
